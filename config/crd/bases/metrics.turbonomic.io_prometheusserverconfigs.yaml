                  ClusterConfigs is an optional list of ClusterConfiguration structs that specify information about the clusters

                            Use this field to specify different labels for each cluster.
                            These labels, if exists, will be used in PromQL queries to filter metrics from a specific cluster.
                            For example, the following labels could be used to select metrics from the "production" cluster in the
                            "us-west-2" region.
                                clusterLabels := map[string]string {
